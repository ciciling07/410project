(I feel insecure, so I think I have something in my hand that makes me feel like Forsythia suspensa, because I think I'm going to be fat anytime, and then I know that at least what I put there is like that, and then when my child goes to school, I can sell it, uh-huh-huh, just think he's already there. After going abroad to study, it is possible to use it, so I think the result of this discussion is, well, Zhou Weifang has another reason that I also think of a better point.)

5 min-6 min: 你觉得保值也不值现在所以嗯我们但是至少这个钱，最后买第一个房子电话嗯这个嗯

(I said my son, there are still many conditions for you to do what you think is right. Then you didn't investigate and I don't know that paying the spot tax is Hill. We invaded at that time. We can change a way. No swimming pool needs to run so far. I can use it directly. We recommend it to ourselves every day. My son gave it away, so I want to change in the process of change, not to say that I must try to change in the process of finally finding out whether to change, but what exactly to use, then I am trying to change my cultivation needs, I think I want to change one with this, in the process of this need, I will continue to return. Hello, I have a small one here that I can consider. The second one is ten. It doesn't mean that we have to buy a second one at the beginning or that it's stable. It's not that we are in the process.)

(Instead of saying you're sitting there with a virus and thinking about it after infection, I'm going to change it. Instead, I know directly that buying evidence can be like this. It's not a thing of the past, it's not directly for me. You can't just go and try it. You can see it again. Uh-huh, uh-huh.)
9 min-10 min: 那我就换罗，小的合适我们就买再买，可是当时我给。

(Well, then we're going to start discussing, and that's what we did. You started running in Youxi County, and then we talked for ten minutes. If you focus on one thing your wife wants to do, you want to do one thing, and then you can talk about yourself first and change that way. Still, do you want to listen? Say I love what I want to do is to have a garden community.)
12 min-13 min: 肯定不能时时相聚，所以呢我觉得我可以经常去那搞有花园的地方待着说我可以去教室呀，去爬山啊，去植物园等地，我也可以自己在家里洗地方有鲜花，嗯，有点迟，然后曾经看过龙游站阳台上开着，但是我们要各奔东西了是。
（Surely I can't get together from time to time, so I think I can always go to the place where there are gardens and wait to say that I can go to the classroom, climb mountains, go to botanical gardens and so on. I can also wash flowers at my home. Well, it's a little late. Then I saw the balcony of Longyou Station blooming, but we have to go east and west. Yes.）
